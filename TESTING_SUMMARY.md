### 4. **Key Testing Features**

- **🔥 REAL DATA**: No mocks - uses actual job postings and real AI responses
- **💾 Data Persistence**: Saves job data between tests for continuity
- **📝 Test Resume**: Complete professional resume stored as constant
- **🔄 Dynamic Testing**: Adapts to current job market conditions
- **⚡ Parallel Testing**: Support for concurrent test execution
- **📊 Coverage Reports**: Built-in coverage analysis

## 🚀 How to Run Tests

```bash
# Navigate to backend
cd backend

# Install dependencies (if not already installed)
bun install

# Run all tests
bun test

# Run unit tests only
bun test:unit

# Run integration tests only  
bun test:integration

# Run with coverage report
bun test:coverage

# Run complete test suite with service startup
bun test:all
```

## 🎨 Example Test Execution

```typescript
// Example: Testing resume optimization with real job
it('Integration: Optimize resume for the specific job', async () => {
  // Use real job from previous search
  const realJob = savedJobData;
  
  // Get actual job description
  const jobDescription = await jobAPI.getDetails(realJob.url);
  
  // Optimize resume using real OpenAI API
  const response = await openAIAPI.optimizeResume({
    resume: TEST_RESUME,
    jobDescription: jobDescription.data.description,
    targetRole: realJob.title
  });
  
  // Validate real response
  expect(response.data.optimizedResume).toBeDefined();
  expect(response.data.suggestions.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
});
```
